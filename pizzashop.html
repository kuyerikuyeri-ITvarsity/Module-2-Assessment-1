                       <h3>PIZZA SHOP</h3>
                       <p>Our World Famous Grinder Bread is mixed and baked fresh every day. Same goes with our Pizza Dough - mixed right in the store and made from scratch.</p>
                       <p>Meats and vegetables are sliced and cut daily.</p>
                       <p>100% Mozzarella Cheese - sure we could use the blended stuff like the "Big Boys" but why would we want to cheapen our products?!</p>
                       <p>Our sauceâ€¦ Without giving away any secrets on our sauce, let me just say our sauce doesn't bite you back. Meaning no citric acid has been added. We want you to enjoy the pure tomato - not the preservatives.</p>
                      
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                      <p>The pizza shop is to the west of the main entrance.e</p>
